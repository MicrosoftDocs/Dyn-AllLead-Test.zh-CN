# <a name="managing-segments"></a>Managing Segments
You create segments to select a group of contacts according to specific criteria. For example, a segment could be the industry that the contacts belong to or your business relationship with the contacts. You can create a segment to select the contacts you want to target with a campaign.

There are two main tasks in creating a segment:

* Enter general information about the segment. Before you can select the contacts within the segment, you must first create the segment.
* Select the contacts to be included within the segment.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
