# <a name="the-getaddressio-uk-postcodes-extension-to-microsoft-dynamics-nav"></a>The GetAddress.io UK Postcodes Extension to Microsoft Dynamics NAV
The GetAddress.io UK Postcodes extension can save time and prevent mistakes when you enter addresses for entities like customers, vendors, bank accounts, and employees. For example, when you're creating a customer, you just choose a postcode and [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] shows a list of addresses. Pick the address you want, and presto, the address fields are filled out.  

## <a name="to-use-the-getaddressio-uk-postcodes-extension-when-you-enter-an-address"></a>To use the GetAddress.io UK Postcodes extension when you enter an address
1. Under **Address**, choose **Look up address from postcode**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
   >   The **Look up address from postcode** option is available only if the **Country/Region Code** field is either empty, or contains **GB**.
2. In the **Postcode Search** window, in the **Postcode** field, enter or choose the postcode.  
3. In the **Address Selection** window, choose the address.  

> [!TIP]  
>   If you know the street number, you can filter the addresses by entering some or all of the number in the **Delivery Point** field.
