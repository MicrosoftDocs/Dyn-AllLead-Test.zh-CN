# <a name="how-to-set-up-alternative-addresses-for-contacts"></a>How to: Set Up Alternative Addresses for Contacts
You can assign an alternate address where your contacts are sometimes sent mail and information, for example, their summer cottage. You can also assign one or several date ranges to each alternate address you have entered for your contacts to specify when each address is valid.

## <a name="to-assign-an-alternate-address"></a>To assign an alternate address
1. Open the contact.
2. Choose the **Alternative Address** action, and then choose **Card**. The **Contact Alt. Address List** window opens.
3. Enter a new alternate address and fill in the fields on the **Contact Alternative Address** window.

Repeat these steps to assign as many alternate addresses as you want. For each alternate address you may want to specify one or several date ranges.

You can also assign alternate addresses from the contact list window by following the same procedure.

Repeat these steps to assign as many date ranges as you want.
