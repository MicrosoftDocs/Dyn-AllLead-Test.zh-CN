# <a name="users-profiles-and-role-centers"></a>Users, Profiles, and Role Centers
The people in your company who have access to [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] are all assigned a *profile* that gives them access to a *Role Center*. As an administrator, you can assign and change profiles in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], and you can add and remove users as part of your [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] subscription.  

## <a name="adding-users"></a>Adding Users
To add users in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)], your company's Office 365 administrator must first create the users in the Office 365 Admin Center. For more information, see [How to: Manage Users and Permissions](ui-how-users-permissions.md).  

## <a name="profiles"></a>Profiles
Profiles are collections of [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] users who share the same Role Center. A Role Center is a type of page on which you can place different parts. Each part is a container in which you can host other pages or pre-defined system parts, such as an Outlook part or parts for adding tasks, notifications, or notes. For more information, see [Managing Profiles](admin-profiles.md).

## <a name="configuration-and-personalization"></a>Configuration and Personalization
The concept of UI customization in [!INCLUDE[navnow_md](includes/navnow_md.md)] is divided in two:  

-   Configuration, performed by the administrator  

    The administrator configures the user interface for multiple users by customizing the user interface for a profile that the users are assigned to. For more information, see [Configuring the User Interface for Users](admin-configure-user-interface.md). 

-   Personalization, performed by users  

    Users personalize the user interface of their personal version by customizing the user interface under their own user logon. This personalization can be deleted by the administrator. For more information, see, [Personalizing Workspaces](ui-personalization-overview.md).
